# Simple As Possible Computer (SAP)

This project implements a loose interpretation of [Malvino and Brown's
SAP-1 computer
architecture](http://deeprajbhujel.blogspot.com/2015/12/sap-1-architecture.html)
(as first described in [Digital Computer Electronics
(1977)](https://books.google.com/books/about/Digital_Computer_Electronics.html?id=mUWN0aIIqzkC)).
The end goal is to replicate [Ben Eater's TTL
Computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyznrdDSSGM&list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU).
Ben made a fascinating series of Youtube videos where he builds and
extends the SAP-1 architecture, using nothing but simple 74xx
transistors, on breadboard. For my CPU, instead of hand wiring logic
chips, the entire design is defined in software, as Verilog code. This
code can be simulated on a workstation, and proven to operate the way
it is intended. Eventually, this software could be turned into real
hardware on an FPGA board.

This code runs with the [Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/)
open source simulation tool on a regular Linux PC. Each component of
the system is written and tested in isolation. Each unit is its own
separate directory, with its own Makefile to run a Python test suite,
written with [cocotb](https://github.com/potentialventures/cocotb).
Adhering to this structure means that every unit is fully modular, and
easier to comprehend and test, by drawing a box around it.

Synthesis is not yet supported. I don't own an FPGA development board
yet, but I plan to check out
[IceStorm](http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/), a fully open source
toolchain, once I do. (I hope I haven't written any non-synthesizable
verilog yet! FPGAs only work with a _subset_ of the Verilog language.)
:/

This same project has been implemented several times, in different
ways, by many people:
 * [JetStarBlues/BenEater_CPU](https://github.com/JetStarBlues/BenEater_CPU)
 * [LuisMichaelis/Computer-Simulation](https://github.com/LuisMichaelis/Computer-Simulation)
 * [ellisgl/sap-1-v2-mojo](https://github.com/ellisgl/sap-1-v2-mojo)
 * [Vdragon/SAP_1](https://github.com/Vdragon/Vdragon_s_Verilog_modules/tree/master/SAP_1)
 * [joshcorbin/sap-1-complete](http://joshcorbin.com/sap-1-complete/)
 
Writing your own version of SAP-1, from scratch, is a worthwhile
project. It can be a very elucidating process, whether it materializes
as physical logic chips, on a breadboard, as Hardware Description
Language, running in a virtual machine... or in any abstraction, not
yet realized. (Could reality itself be composed of sucessive lambda
calculus expressions? [a(b)=1; a(1)=a(a(b))=2;
a(6)=a(a(a(a(a(a(b))))))=7; find b;]) Actually going down the path,
and doing the work yourself, shows you what you did not know before:
there is an understanding of how a thing works, and there is a
knowledge of how a thing works. These are not the same thing.

## The SAP-1

SAP-1 is a simple 8-bit computer architecture with only 128 _bits_ of
memory (16 bytes!), 2 program registers, and 5 instructions. A
*really* simple computer. Here's a comparison with a few other 8 bit
computers:

The two straight lines, going down the middle, represent a shared bus
between components, which is 8 bits wide. The bus can transmit
arbitrary binary data, as well as program instructions. In many other
CPU designs, there are two busses: one for instructions/addresses, and
a separate one for data. The two bus architecture is often called
Harvard design. The SAP-1 design is supposed to be simpler, so both
data, and instructions, share a single bus, like a time-share.

When the bus is used for binary data, all 8 bits of the bus are used.
It's just data. 

When the bus is used for instructions, the 8 bits are split in half:
using the first/left 4 bits (called hiNib) as the Op Code (the 'what'
to do), and the second/right 4 bits (called loNib) as the Operand,
which usually specifies a memory address (the 'thing' to do 'what'
upon).

The other symbols on the diagram with arrows pointing in or out of the
units, are the control signals coming from the main _Control Sequencer_,
discussed later.

## Instruction set

The original SAP-1 has only 5 instructions:

| Instruction | Op code (hiNib) | Operand (loNib)                  | Description                                                    |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| LDA         | 0000            | 4 bit memory address to load     | Load memory at the given address into the accumulator register |
| ADD         | 0001            | 4 bit memory address to add      | Add memory at the given address to the accumulator register    |
| SUB         | 0010            | 4 bit memory address to subtract | Subtract memory at address from accumulator register           |
| OUT         | 1110            | None                             | Send accumulator contents to the output register               |
| HLT         | 1111            | None                             | Halt program                                                   |

The computer is deterministically controlled by the contents of its
RAM. If the RAM contents is changed, then the process of the computer
is changed. Conversely, if the same RAM contents are used multiple
times, the same process is performed every time. Therefore, if you
want the computer to do something, you program the RAM, and the
computer will do what is in the RAM.

The user of SAP-1 is expected to program the RAM before the computer
starts execution. The machine has two modes: program mode, and
execution mode. In program mode, the RAM is disconnected from the bus,
and the user can directly edit the contents of the RAM through input
switches. Both program and data must be input. In execution mode,
these switches are disconnected, and the RAM is connected to the main
bus instead. The RAM provides the program and data for the rest of the
computer to follow and use.

## Example program execution

Here is an example snapshot of the contents of the RAM. The program
containing the instructions always starts at memory address 0000, and
continues until an HLT instruction is found. In this example, the
program is in memory locations 0000 through 0101. Addresses after HLT
is where data storage starts, locations 0110 through 1111, and can
contain data to be used during the execution of the program, using any
of the LDA, ADD, or SUB instructions.

| Memory Address | Memory Contents (hiNib loNib) | Decoded Instruction | Description                                                                                                    |

Once the user has programmed all of this data into RAM, the computer
is switched to execution mode. The Program Counter (PC) counts from
0000 to 1111 (or until HLT), which advances through all the memory
addresses, one by one. Starting at memory address 0000, the first
instruction is read, and then executed (LDA 9). The Program Counter
advances to 0001, and the second memory address is read (ADD E), and
then executed, and so on. Once memory address 5 (0101) is read, an HLT
instruction is parsed, and execution stops.

 * The computer program calculates : 16 + 127 - 64
 * Then outputs: 79
 * Then calculates 79 + (-86), but does not display the answer.
 * Then stops.

## Control Sequencer

Since all the components share a single bus, there has to be something
that ensures that only one thing writes to the bus at a time. This
controller should also coordinate when a unit should read from the
bus, and when to ignore it. The letters with arrows, represented in
the diagram, show lines coming from a central controller out to each
of the individual units of the system. The controller fetches an
instruction from RAM, decodes the instruction into the Instruction
Register, and based on this input, the Controller knows what
components to talk to, to carry out the instruction. It has dedicated
wires (not the main bus), running to all the various parts of the
system, and ensures things happen in the right sequence.

These are the control signals output from the main controller:

| Control Signal | Name               | Description                                                                                                                        |

The 'controller' is shorthand for _Control Sequencer_, as it controls
the process of a single instruction over the duration of several
sequential clock cycles. For the sake of simplicity, the orginal SAP-1
controller defined every instruction as taking 6 clock cycles (or 6
t-states). (Not every instruction needed all of those 6 cycles, but it
is simpler to implement if you just wait out the unused cycles doing
nothing.) Each t-state of the instruction is carried out sequentially,
with the controller outputing different control signals depending on
the current instruction and step. The controller is designed to handle
each type of instruction, and carries out the step-sequence of the
control signals necessary for the given instruction.

For example, let's examine the execution of a single instruction:
**LDA**. From the perspective of the controller, this requires 6 steps
(only 4 used for LDA). Each part of a step happens in parallel:

 1. Do the following _Memory Fetch_ operations, in parallel:
 
     - Tell the Program Counter (PC) to output the current program
       pointer to the main bus. This is the next 'line number' of our
       program to execute, (actually it's the address pointing to it,
       in memory). Any component could potentially now read this value
       from the bus, but will not do so unless the _Control Sequencer_
       tells it to.
       
     - The Memory Address Register (MAR) is told to read this value
       from the main bus. For this moment, the MAR and the PC now
       contain the same value.

 2. Do the following _Memory Fetch_ operations, in parallel:
 
     - Tell the Memory (RAM) to lookup the memory stored at the
       address that the MAR holds, and output the data to the main
       bus.

     - Tell the Instruction Register (IR) to read from the main bus,
       to decode, and store the current instruction.

     - The Instruction Register (IR) is always connected to the
       _Control Sequencer_, outputting the decoded Opcode from the
       stored instruction (the hiNib, the 'what to do'; LDA in this
       example). This Opcode informs the _Control Sequencer_ in its
       decision for what to do in subsequent steps.

     - Tell the Program Counter (PC) to increment itself, in
       preparation for the next instruction (which won't occur until
       all the steps of the current instruction finish).
 
 3. Do the following _LDA specific_ operations, in parallel:
 
     - Tell the Instruction Register (IR) to output the instruction to
       the bus. The memory address operand of the LDA instruction is
       now on the lower 8 bits (loNib) of the main bus.

     - Tell the Memory Address Register (MAR) to load from the main
       bus. This is the address to load from memory in the next step.

 4. Do the following _LDA specific_ operations, in parallel:
 
     - Tell the Memory (RAM) to lookup the data from the MAR address,
       and output it to the main bus. Now the bus contains the
       contents of memory specified by the LDA instruction.

     - Tell Register A to read from the main bus. Now Register A
       contains the data the LDA instruction told it to load. This
       completes the LDA instruction.

 5. No operation. Just wait.

     - Malvino's SAP-1 always used 6 T-states for instructions, so
       instructions that don't need these extra T-states just waited
       out the unused cycles, doing nothing.

 6. No operation. Just wait.

     - (In Verilog, we trim off these unused T-states, because we
       can.)
 
The above explanation may seem overly complicated, and expressed in
words, it is. Each step can be simplified if written with
combinatorial logic, using the Control Signal names as labels. Here
are all five of the orignal SAP-1 instructions, each expressed as a
control sequence comprised of 6 t-states (not all used):

| Instruction | T-1    | T-2    | T-3    | T-4    | T-5            | T-6 |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|----------------|-----|
| LDA         | MI, CO | RO, CI | MI, IO | RO, AI |                |     |
| ADD         | MI, CO | RO, CI | MI, IO | RO, BI | AI, Î£O, FI     |     |
| SUB         | MI, CO | RO, CI | MI, IO | RI, BI | AI, Î£O, SU, FI |     |
| OUT         | MI, CO | RO, CI | AO, OI |        |                |     |
| HLT         | MI, CO | RO, CI | HLT    |        |                |     |

Notice that for all of the instructions, the first two t-states are
identical. T-1 and T-2, combined, are called the Fetch cycle, as it is
the same steps that any instruction will need to perform in order to
load the next instruction from RAM. Steps T-3 through T-6 are specific
to the Instruction type, and are therefore different for each
instruction.

These control sequences are implemented in the hardware design of the
_Control Sequencer_. This is easy to do in Verilog, because if you want
to modify the architecture, perhaps to add a new type of Instruction,
you just modify the code. In Ben's breadboard design, he implemented
these control sequences as an eeprom. This makes his design flexible,
should he want to add additional instructions (see the next section).
To do so, he does not need to change any of the existing wires, just
reprogram the eeprom. In our Verilog design, the whole implementation
is programmed, so this is an unnecessary complication. We don't need
microcode, we can just hardcode the control sequences directly into
the _Control Sequencer_ implementation, and recompile when changes are
made. (This decision is more conducive to FPGA implementation than
ASIC design. An ASIC that supports microcode is software upgradeable.
A hardcoded ASIC implementation is not.)

## Is SAP-1 really a computer though?

With only five instructions, the only things SAP-1 can do are: Read
memory; Add and Subtract 8 bit numbers; Show the result; and Stop.
This is a calculator, not a full computer. To make this system useful,
more instructions need to be created. (Up to 16 instructions can be
created, using 4bit op codes.) As Ben shows, in his video [Making a
computer Turing
complete](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqNDk_UJW4k), its only a
handful of additonal instructions that are necessary to make this a
universal Turing Machine <sup>(still only with 16B of memory)</sup>.
Ben uses a modified instruction set (note the opcode changes):

| Instruction | Op code (hiNib) | Operand (loNib)                    | Description                                                                                     |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NOP         | 0000            | None                               | No operation                                                                                    |
| LDA         | 0001            | 4 bit memory address to read       | Read the contents of the given memory address, store it in the A register.                      |
| ADD         | 0010            | 4 bit memory address to add        | Add the contents of the given memory address to the A register.                                 |
| SUB         | 0011            | 4 bit memory address to subtract   | Subtract the contents of the given memory address from the A register.                          |
| STA         | 0100            | 4 bit memory address to write      | Write the contents of the A register into the memory at the given address.                      |
| LDI         | 0101            | 4 bit number to give to A directly | Load Data Immediately into register A, given the operand number (0-15). No RAM read.            |
| JMP         | 0110            | 4 bit number to give to P. Counter | Jump. Set the Program Counter to the given operand, which will be the next instruction pointer. |
| JC          | 0111            | 4 bit number to give to P. Counter | Jump conditionally, on carry flag.                                                              |
| JZ          | 1000            | 4 bit number to give to P. Counter | Jump conditionally, on zero flag.                                                               |
| OUT         | 1110            | None                               | Send accumulator contents to the output register.                                               |
| HLT         | 1111            | None                               | Halt program.                                                                                   |

The addition of the ability to store data back to RAM, and the three
new jump instructions, provide the capabilities of a Turing Machine; a
computer that is capable of calculating any calculable problem
<sup>(within memory constraints)</sup>.
