A simple demo on how to use webpack

https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/

Must have `--save`

```
npm install --save lodash
```

The `dist` folder should be empty (only have the `index.html` file inside)
on running `npx webpack` or `npx webpack --config webpack.config.js`, `main.js` should generate in the dist folder
Can also run `npm run build`
